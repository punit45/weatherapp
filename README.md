# Weather Website

A website where you can fetch the weather for your current location as well as any location in the world.




## Features

- There are two tabs and the user can easily toggle between them.  
- There is a Grant Location Button that asks for allowing the access to your current location.
- Fully Responsive and looks awesome on mobile devices too.



## Lessons Learned

- Building this project was exciting as well as challenging for me.
- My JavaScript learnings were improved a lot.
- I got to learn about how to fetch Data from an API and convert the response into JSON format to extract data from it.
- The UI of the project is completely dynamic where the data is displayed using JavaScript.
- There are a couple of Event Listeners added in the website especially in the search icon to handle it's behaviour when it's clicked.
